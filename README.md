# YT Frame Timer
A JavaScript-based program to determine the time between start and end points of a YouTube video down to the frame. The tool was originally created to help moderators retime speedruns on [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com). Based on [Slush Puppy's Retime Tool (SPRT)](https://github.com/Slush0Puppy/retime) by @SlushPuppy (big thanks to them for their work).
